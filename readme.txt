Resize images from your theme templates, on-the-fly.

== Description ==

Use the Instant Image Resize to resize images from your theme templates. Using the plugin you can have
multiple sized thumbnails of an image without multiple fields/uploads.

== Installation ==

Simply upload the plugin to your plugins directory. Note that the system caches images after 
resize(you can force an image to be regenerated) so the directory needs to be writable.
